# GDACS

Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (EU/UN). Multi-hazard: earthquakes,
cyclones, floods, volcanoes, drought, wildfires. Each event carries a colour-coded
alert level.

## Endpoint

GeoJSON event list (verified 6 Jul 2026):

    https://www.gdacs.org/gdacsapi/api/events/geteventlist/EVENTS4APP

RSS alternative: `https://www.gdacs.org/xml/rss.xml`. Per-event detail hangs off
`url.details` inside each feature.

## Detail feed — population-exposure fields (per hazard)

`geteventdata?eventtype=<T>&eventid=<ID>` is the ONLY grounded source of an exposed-population
figure (the EVENTS4APP list carries none — corrects the truncated sample above). Figures are
carried verbatim, never derived (ADR 0007). Pinned from captured fixtures in
`pipeline/tests/fixtures/gdacs_detail_<hazard>.json`.

| Hazard | Exposure field (under `properties`)        | Notes                                  |
|--------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| EQ     | `earthquakedetails.rapidpop` (+ `rapidpopdescription`) | API-verified; MMI-band exposure |
| TC     | none published — confirmed absent → null + reason | `gdacs_detail_tc.json`: `severitydata` holds max wind speed (`severity`/`severitytext`/`severityunit`), not a population; `affectedcountries` is country names only, `images.populationmap` is a PNG URL. Removed from `_EXPOSURE_FIELDS`. |
| FL     | none published — confirmed absent → null + reason | `gdacs_detail_fl.json`: `severitydata` holds flood magnitude, not a population; `impacts`/`additionalinfos` empty. Removed from `_EXPOSURE_FIELDS`. |
| VO     | none published — detail not captured (no active volcano in the list feed this slice) → null + reason | Left out of `_EXPOSURE_FIELDS` (no unverified path, ADR 0007); revisit when a VO detail can be captured. |
| DR     | — (GDACS publishes no per-event count)     | Ships `null` + documented reason; not present in `_EXPOSURE_FIELDS`. No active drought in the list feed this slice to capture. |

## Open questions

1. Every event carries `alertlevel`, `alertscore`, `episodealertlevel` and
   `episodealertscore`. Which of these is "the alert level" for reporting
   purposes — and can an event's colour change after you have already
   reported on it?
2. This event's `source` is `NEIC` — the same US agency behind the USGS feed.
   When the same physical earthquake arrives from two of your three feeds,
   what makes two records the same event?
3. GDACS publishes no rate limits and no uptime guarantees. What is a polite
   polling frequency, and what does your 08:30 report say on a morning the
   feed is down?
